# My 2021 Tiny Tower experience

This directory contains my Tiny Tower pictures from all of 2021.

2021 contains months 21 to 32.

On January 26th 2021, my consecutive day streak broke when I couldn't play Tiny Tower that night. My phone recently updated, and now the app crashed upon start and would not load. I attempted a few day later, but I didn't feel like playing anymore. I didn't play for the rest of the month (and still have not resumed gameplay as of March 8th 2021)

## Some notes

1. I did not get any screenshots for every month after January, as I didn't feel like playing at all this month (as of March 8th 2021)

2. With my new phone, screenshots are in 2400x1080 resolution, instead of 2560x1440 on my last phone.

3. I used to play the Android version of Tiny Tower, but stopped playing daily on January 26th 2021. I have not yet resumed as of March 8th 2021

4. Images are in JPG format.

5. I used to play on a daily basis, but stopped on January 26th 2021, and have not resumed as of March 8th 2021

6. No other notes for this month
