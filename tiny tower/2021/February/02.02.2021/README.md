# Notice - Didn't play

I was unable to play Tiny Tower today due to the game not being functional on Android 11 (I was recently forced to downgrade from Android 10 to Android 11) as such, Tiny Tower and some other apps no longer work.

I am still upset that I can't play this game, as I have recently really gotten into it, and really enjoyed playing it. The forced "upgrade" also caused me to lose a 620+ consecutive day streak.

I am still waiting for NimbleBit to release an update that adds Android 11 support.

Update: when testing the game again today to show a family member how the game was crashing, the game didn't crash. This was on January 28th 2021. 

You can view my Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinytower/comments/l6q10r/android_11_game_no_longer_loads_immediate_crash/).

On January 29th 2021, I wanted to play the game again, but didn't have the time to play, nor felt like playing tonight.

As of February 2nd 2021, I have not resumed gameplay.
