# My February 2021 Tiny Tower experience

This directory contains my Tiny Tower pictures from all of February 2021 (total: 0)

February 2021 would have been my 22nd consecutive month playing Tiny Tower if the game didn't mess up last month.

On January 26th 2021, my consecutive day streak broke when I couldn't play Tiny Tower that night. My phone recently updated, and now the app crashed upon start and would not load. I attempted a few day later, but I didn't feel like playing anymore. I didn't play for the rest of the month (and still have not resumed gameplay as of March 8th 2021)

## Some notes

1. I did not get any screenshots this month, as I didn't feel like playing at all this month

2. With my new phone, screenshots are in 2400x1080 resolution, instead of 2560x1440 on my last phone.

3. I used to play the Android version of Tiny Tower

4. Images were in JPG format

5. I used to play on a daily basis

6. No other notes for this month
