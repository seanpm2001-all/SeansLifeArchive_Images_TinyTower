# January 26th 2021 - The game isn't working

Last night at 6:00 pm, my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE was force-updated from Android 10 to Android 11. Upon discovery at past 8:30 pm, I hated most of the interface changes, and the decrease in performance. Later that night, I tried opening Tiny Tower, to find that Android 11 broke compatibility for the app. The app auto crashed and wouldn't stay loaded for more than 3 seconds. I wasn't able to play tonight, breaking a nearly 2 year tradition, and breaking my 600+ consecutive day streak, all because my phone was auto-updated without my permission. This has further leveraged my strong hate for Google. Due to this, I am giving less time to my phone, so that a message can be sent, even if it is really small. I am going to have to wait a while for NimbleBit to produce an update supporting Android 11. My phone has lost lots of functionality, and now I am starting to hate it. It used to be my best device, but now it has a worse battery, an even worse interface, and decreased functionality.

I will not be able to play Tiny Tower for a while.
