# Notice - Didn't play

I was unable to play Tiny Tower today due to the game not being functional on Android 11 (I was recently forced to downgrade from Android 10 to Android 11) as such, Tiny Tower and some other apps no longer work.

I am still upset that I can't play this game, as I have recently really gotten into it, and really enjoyed playing it. The forced "upgrade" also caused me to lose a 620+ consecutive day streak.

I am still waiting for NimbleBit to release an update that adds Android 11 support.

You can view my Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinytower/comments/l6q10r/android_11_game_no_longer_loads_immediate_crash/).

I have not been able to play since January 26th 2021. As of January 27th 2021, I still cannot play Tiny Tower.
