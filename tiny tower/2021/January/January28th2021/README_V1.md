# Notice - Didn't play

I was unable to play Tiny Tower today due to the game not being functional on Android 11 (I was recently forced to downgrade from Android 10 to Android 11) as such, Tiny Tower and some other apps no longer work.

I am still upset that I can't play this game, as I have recently really gotten into it, and really enjoyed playing it. The forced "upgrade" also caused me to lose a 620+ consecutive day streak.

I am still waiting for NimbleBit to release an update that adds Android 11 support.

Update: when testing the game again today to show a family member how the game was crashing, the game didn't crash. I wanted to go to bed much earlier tonight, so I didn't play. I am going to try again tonight on January 29th 2021 if I have the time and interest. I am hoping it doesn't start crashing again.

You can view my Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinytower/comments/l6q10r/android_11_game_no_longer_loads_immediate_crash/).

I have not been able to play since January 26th 2021. As of January 28th 2021, I still cannot play Tiny Tower, but I might be able to play tomorrow.
