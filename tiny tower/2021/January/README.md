# My January 2021 Tiny Tower experience

This directory contains my Tiny Tower pictures from all of January 2021.

January 2021 is my 21st and last (for now) consecutive month playing Tiny Tower.

On January 26th 2021, my consecutive day streak broke when I couldn't play Tiny Tower that night. My phone recently updated, and now the app crashed upon start and would not load. I attempted a few day later, but I didn't feel like playing anymore. I didn't play for the rest of the month (and still have not resumed gameplay as of March 8th 2021)

## Some notes

1. I got screenshots for this month from January 1st 2021 to January 25th 2021

2. With my new phone, screenshots are in 2400x1080 resolution, instead of 2560x1440 on my last phone.

3. I play the Android version of Tiny Tower

4. Images are in JPG format

5. I play on a daily basis

6. No other notes for this month
