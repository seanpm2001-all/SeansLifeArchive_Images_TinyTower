# My January 2020 Tiny Tower experience

This directory contains my Tiny Tower pictures from all of January 2020

January 2020 is my 9th consecutive month playing Tiny Tower.

I started playing the game again on May 9th 2019. The last time I played before this was an attempt in 2015 when Mobage shut down, and I couldn't create an account due to low experience, and before that, on iOS between 2010 and 2012.

It turned into a daily tradition from this pointward onward up to January 26th 2021.
