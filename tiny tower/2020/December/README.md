# My December 2020 Tiny Tower experience

This directory contains my Tiny Tower pictures from all of December 2020

December 2020 is my 20th consecutive month playing Tiny Tower.

I started playing the game again on May 9th 2019. The last time I played before this was an attempt in 2015 when Mobage shut down, and I couldn't create an account due to low experience, and before that, on iOS between 2010 and 2012.

It turned into a daily tradition from this pointward onward up to January 26th 2021.

## Some notes

1. I got screenshots for this month from December 1st 2020 to December 31st 2020

2. Screenshots for this month are in 2400x1080 resolution.

3. On December 13th 2020, I switched from a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge to a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. The game had an interface change due to this (the notch) and the quality of images dropped from 2560x1440 to 2400x1080. This change lasted for the rest of the month, and also the rest of 2020.

4. I play the Android version of Tiny Tower

5. Images are in JPG format

6. I play on a daily basis

7. No other notes for this month
