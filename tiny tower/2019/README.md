# My 2019 Tiny Tower experience

This directory contains my Tiny Tower pictures from all of 2019

I started playing the game again on May 9th 2019. The last time I played before this was an attempt in 2015 when Mobage shut down, and I couldn't create an account due to low experience, and before that, on iOS between 2010 and 2012.

It turned into a daily tradition from this pointward onward up to January 26th 2021.

This year (2019) has 8 consecutive months of gameplay.
