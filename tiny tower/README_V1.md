# My Tiny Tower experience

This directory contains my Tiny Tower pictures from all of 2019 to 2021.

I started playing the game again on May 9th 2019. The last time I played before this was an attempt in 2015 when Mobage shut down, and I couldn't create an account due to low experience, and before that, on iOS between 2010 and 2012.

It turned into a daily tradition from this pointward onward up to January 26th 2021.

On January 26th 2021, my phone was auto updated, and kept crashing upon attempting to open Tiny Tower. The issue resolved a couple days later, but it was already too late, and I didn't feel like playing.

I have yet to gain interest in playing again. I have not played again as of March 8th 2021.
